### Capture Modes {#capture-mode}

The Workshop Capture app provides four capture modes.

To capture a wall of sticky notes or index cards, use the "Columns" or "Groups" capture modes.

To capture handwritten text, use the "Lists" or "Text Boxes" capture modes.

*The screen where you select your Capture Mode.*

![Capture Mode](/capture/documentation/images/capture_mode.png){:width="200px"}



#### Capturing sticky notes {#capture-mode-sticky-notes}

#### Columns
Use this mode with sticky notes that are arranged in columns such as a Kanban board.

The app will recognise each individual sticky note as well as the columns that you have them organised in.

Using the app in this mode allows you to capture your wall of sticky notes and replicate the columns in your digital tool.

See our guide on [how to capture sticky notes in columns](#image-capture-columns)


#### Groups
Use this mode to capture sticky notes organised in groups.

In this mode, the app will recognise the text on each individual sticky note and organise all notes in each image into a group.

It is perfect for brainstorming workshops or when you want to capture a large number of notes.

See our guide on [how to capture sticky notes in groups](#image-capture-groups)



#### Capturing whiteboard/ notebook notes {#capture-mode-handrwritten-notes}

#### Lists
Use this mode to capture handwritten text lists (i.e. on whiteboards, notebooks etc).

It is perfect for capturing a to-do list or action items from meetings or workshops.

Each line of text is considered a new list item.

See our guide on [how to capture lists](#image-capture-lists)


#### Text Boxes
Use this mode to capture paragraphs of text. Draw a box around each paragraph to create a new card in your digital tool.

Each block of text is treated like a 'sticky note'.

It is perfect if you don't have sticky notes at hand and want to create Jira tickets on a whiteboard or butchers paper.

See our guide on [how to capture text boxes](#image-capture-boxes)

### How to capture images {#image-capture}

After selecting a capture mode you can now add images to your project.

You can either:
1. Take a photo
2. Select from your gallery

**You will need to grant the WallSync Capture app access to your Camera and / or Photos in order for the app to work**

In all capture modes you can take (or select from your gallery) multiple photos in quick succession. Adding more photos while others process enables you to capture a large wall of notes or text quickly.

When you have finished uploading your images and they are done processing, tap "Next" in the top right corner.

*The start of the image capture processs.*

*When taken, the image is then processed.*

*When processing finishes, you can preview the image by taping it, add more images or move to the next step by tapping "Next".*

#### How to get best results when capturing my wall
To get the **best results**, follow these steps:

1. Write as neatly as you can - if a human can't read it neither can a computer (yet)!
2. Take a maximum of 15 notes or lines of text in each image.
3. If using sticky notes, try to arrange them neatly. Avoid overlapping notes.
4. Take clear images where the handwriting is clearly visible.
5. Ensure you have good lighting in the room.
6. Use dark pens, whiteboard markers or sharpies.
7. Contrast the colour between the wall and the sticky notes or index cards (i.e. pink sticky notes on a white wall)

Below we have detailed each capture mode and tips to help make them work best.




#### How to capture sticky notes in columns {#image-capture-columns}

In this mode, the app will recognise each individual sticky note as well as the columns that you have them organised in.

For this to work accurately it is best to arrange your notes neatly within each column and leave a clear space (at least 2-3 centimetres) between each column.

You can capture up to 3 columns in each photo. Remember to capture a maximum of 15-20 notes in each image.




#### How to capture sticky notes in groups {#image-capture-groups}

In this mode, the app will recognise the text on each individual sticky note and organise all notes in each image into a group.

For best results, arrange your sticky notes into neat groups. Avoid overlapping them.

Aim to capture each group in one photo. If a group has more than 15 notes, split the group and take multiple photos.



#### How to capture lists {#image-capture-lists}

In this mode, you can capture handwritten text lists (i.e. on whiteboards, notebooks etc).

Each line of text is considered a new list item.

Make sure your text is legible. If you can't read it then chances are neither can we (although we'll still try)!

Each photo will create a separate list. These can be combined should you need.

Aim to take clear images where the text is sharp. Reduce glare on whiteboards for better results.



#### How to capture text boxes {#image-capture-boxes}

In this mode, you can draw a box around paragraphs of text and the app will convert each box of text into a card.

You can capture up to 4 boxes of text in each image.

Each photo will organise all text boxes in that photo into a different column. These columns can be combined should you need.

For best results, aim to draw neat boxes (rectangles or squares) and leave a gap of 3-4 centimetres between each box of text.

### Edit and organise your notes {#organise}

In the Edit and organise screen, you can check the accuracy of the handwriting recognition, add cards, delete cards, edit text, edit column or group names, merge columns or move cards between columns.

### FAQs {#faqs}

#### Will it recognise my messy handwriting?
Probably! Try it out as it far more accurate than most people expect.

Generally, if a human can't read your handwriting then neither can a computer. The WallSync Capture app does use the context of the words you have written to help be more accurate.

#### Where can I export my notes?
You can export your notes to Trello, Jira Cloud and Jira Server. More integrations are coming soon.

Want us to add a different export integration - [get in touch ](#feedback)

#### Does it work with index cards?
Yes, the app will work with sticky notes and index cards.

While it still works in most cases, you should try to avoid using white index cards on white walls.

#### Why do I need to give access to my Camera or Photos?
The WallSync Capture app needs access to your phones camera and/ or photos in order to function and process your handwriting.

#### How much does it cost?
See our [pricing page](https://www.wallsync.net/capture/pricing/)
