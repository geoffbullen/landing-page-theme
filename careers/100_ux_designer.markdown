Part-time User Experience (UX) Designer 
====================

### What we are looking for

We need someone to bring a designers mindset and eye to WallSync!   Built by techies; we need help creating a fantastic user experience.   

- Someone who believes that in design (as in life?) less is more 
- Someone that has strong opinions and is willing to defend them; yet not entrenched and very open to new ideas
- Someone that will collaborate with the team to get their design vision implemented
- Someone that welcomes the unstructured environment and opportunities of an early stage startup

### Where we're at

WallSync is a startup that has just received funding from a leading Australian startup accelerator and investment fund.  We are now building the team to make the most of this opportunity

### What we’re building

WallSync bridges the gab between physical face-to-face workshops and your digital tools.  We use smart (and fun) technology like Computer Vision, Augmented Reality and Machine Learning to build a frictionless interface between the physical world and your digital tools.

- Ability to create high-quality visual designs, wireframes and user flows (e.g. in  Sketch &  InVision)
- Strong visual design skills and knowledge of design principles (colour, layout, typography)
- Graphic design

###  Nice to haves

- An understanding of HTML and CSS
- Copywriting skills
