Overview
--------------------

Flow Technologies maintains the WallSync application and manages the infrastructure that it runs on.


Data storage
--------------------

Our platform runs on the Amazon cloud and has been designed for scaleability, redundancy and fail over.  If there is an
issue with any given node we can automatically and seamlessly provision new ones.

People and Access
--------------------

Flow technologies support staff are the only people with access to the WallSync servers.

Privacy
--------------------

Flow technologies understands the importance of keeping your data private.  We do not store or share any kind of private information
on our servers.  User names and passwords aren't stored by us, only within the mobile application itself.
