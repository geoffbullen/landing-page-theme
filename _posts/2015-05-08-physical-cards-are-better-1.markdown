title: Physical agile story walls are better - number 1 they can actually be more accurate
description: A physical agile story card wall can be more accurate than a virtual story card wall.

It sounds counter-intuitive, but physical agile cards can give you more accuracy.   This is because of the **behaviours they
 encourage**.

A common formula for a [standup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) -    _“Yesterday I worked on X, today I am working on Y; and I have no impediments”_.

It’s simple and it works great, it keeps the everyone up to date with what the team is doing, helps highlight dependencies
and gives the [scrum master](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29#Scrum_master) and management the information they need to handle things that prevent the team from being
productive.   It also helps keep stand ups short (and sweet?).

But...

What I used to find though is that a lot of the activity our team was doing wasn’t related to tasks on the wall.
They were usually the right things for the team to be working on and often required in order to deliver the stories
we’d committed to; but they weren’t always the tasks we’d come up with in our sprint planning.   This is fine, __no
plan is going to be perfect__ and you shouldn’t expect it to be.   What you do want however is to maximise the
opportunity for the team to learn from the current sprint in order to be able to plan better for the next.

Although it seems obvious, it is really easy to miss this.  You hear lots of good stuff getting achieved each
day and it is all relevant to the current sprint.    Great.  The impact though, is that your task wall is no
longer an accurate reflection of the currents sprint activity.

Using [physical cards](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) (if you do it effectively) rather than an [agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) tool will actually give you a more accurate task wall.

By requiring team members to point to or hold the task card when saying the words, the work being done shows up as either…

1. planned work for which there is a [task card](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/task-boards) on the wall
2. unplanned work for which there should be a card on the wall
3. unplanned work that is not related to a story on the wall

This sounds like a no brainer, but in my experience it is #2 and #3 that often don’t get handled by teams.
By having a physical card you can pick up and hold in your hard is what makes this work.

When I start with a new team, one of the questions I most often ask while trying to keep the stand ups on track is
“what card are you talking about”.   I imagine it is quite annoying…   But very quickly, usually after a day or two,
 we find that our conversations are relevant to the tasks and the tasks are relevant to the sprint.

 With physical cards __the barriers to making a change are minimal__.   Scribble some words on an index card to add to scope,
 or rip up a card to remove it from scope (this can also be more satisfying).

Now when we go into our retrospectives and when we plan the next sprint, we know the tasks and
activities from the prior sprint that we’d missed.   We also have a better idea of the activities the
 team had to do that weren’t related to delivering the stories; and so could either take actions to reduce
 (e.g. meetings not related to the project) or better understand our true capacity when planning...

This little tweak, made a massive difference to us, please share yours...
