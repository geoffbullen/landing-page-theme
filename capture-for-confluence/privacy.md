Overview

Our platform runs on the Google cloud and has been designed for scaleability, redundancy and fail over.  If there is an issue with any given node we can automatically and seamlessly provision new ones.

People and Access

WallSync support staff are the only people with access to the WallSync servers.

Privacy
--------------------

WallSync understands the importance of keeping your data private.  We do not store or share any kind of user identifier (such as email, phone number) on our servers.  User names and passwords aren't stored by us.
