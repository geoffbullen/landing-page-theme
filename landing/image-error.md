# Critical fix: InvalidImageDimensions
 <br/>
We have just released a new version to fix an issue with processing large images from iPhones.    If you saw this message it was the fix for that!

**NOTE: You might need to force an update by clicking on your profile icon in the iOS app store and selecting Update Now.**
