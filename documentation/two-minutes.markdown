Try it in 1 minute..
====================

Only have a minute and want to get a flavour of WallSync?
Simply install the plugin, generate the cards and scan on your computer screen.

 - Install the JIRA add-on
 - Generate the cards (click the WallSync top menu item and select a board)
 - From the mobile app, enter your JIRA credentials and select a board
 - Start syncing.  Select a column and you will see something similar to the below.

What this shows you:

 - The cards that match your selected column will be green
 - The others will display an orange circle, along with the acronym of the column that they are in
 - If you were to press sync (**DON'T do this if the board is in use!!**), all the cards would be updated to match the selected column
