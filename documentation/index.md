## The Capture flow

#### Tips for taking photos
To get the best results, follow these steps:

- Take multiple photos if you have lots of notes to give us the best chance of getting 100% accurate handwriting recognition
- Write as neatly as you can - if a human canâ€™t read it, neither can a computer (yet)!
- If using sticky notes, try to arrange them neatly. Avoid overlapping notes.
- Take clear images where the handwriting is clearly visible.
- Ensure you have good lighting in the room.
- Use dark pens, whiteboard markers or sharpies.
- Contrast the colour between the wall and the sticky notes or index cards (i.e. pink sticky notes on a white wall)

## The Canvas - where organisation happens

## Using the canvas to organise notes {#canvas}

The Wallsync canvas is where you can 
1. organise your notes into categories
2. add multiple photos to build up a complete story of a workshop or meeting

### Long-press to rearrange a note

If you'd like to rearrange the position of a note or move it to a different category, press down on it for a second and you'll be able to drag it to a different position
