## The Capture flow

#### Tips for taking photos
To get the best results, follow these steps:

- Take multiple photos if you have lots of notes to give us the best chance of getting 100% accurate handwriting recognition
- Write as neatly as you can - if a human canâ€™t read it, neither can a computer (yet)!
- If using sticky notes, try to arrange them neatly. Avoid overlapping notes.
- Take clear images where the handwriting is clearly visible.
- Ensure you have good lighting in the room.
- Use dark pens, whiteboard markers or sharpies.
- Contrast the colour between the wall and the sticky notes or index cards (i.e. pink sticky notes on a white wall)


## Capture steps
### Take your photo and name the group
You can either use the embedded camera, or use a saved image from your device library

  **NOTE:** you have to take the photos in portrait.   However, you can select both landscape and portrait images from your devicexs library

### Review and make changes

Quickly see the recogniosed text come to life. You can make text changes here or remove unwanted notes.

When it looks good, it gets added to the canvas, where you can continue to add new photos.

## Using the canvas to organise notes {#canvas}

The Wallsync canvas is where you can 
1. organise your notes into categories
2. add multiple photos to build up a complete story of a workshop or meeting

### Long-press to rearrange a note

If you'd like to rearrange the position of a note or move it to a different category, press down on it for a second and you'll be able to drag it to a different position
