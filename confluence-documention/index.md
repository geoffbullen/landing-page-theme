### About

The Capture Anything Confluence plugin allows you to quickly transform handwritten sticky notes, diagram,  lists and text boxes into your digital tools.

#### Tips for taking photos
To get the best results, follow these steps:

- Take multiple photos if you have lots of notes to give us the best chance of getting 100% accurate handwriting recognition
- Write as neatly as you can - if a human canâ€™t read it, neither can a computer (yet)!
- If using sticky notes, try to arrange them neatly. Avoid overlapping notes.
- Take clear images where the handwriting is clearly visible.
- Ensure you have good lighting in the room.
- Use dark pens, whiteboard markers or sharpies.
- Contrast the colour between the wall and the sticky notes or index cards (i.e. pink sticky notes on a white wall)
